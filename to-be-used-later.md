“In December, we return for the final chapter of STEP. We see that not as a graduation—but as a checkpoint.”

Our goal by then:

Be a confident, independent contributor in projects.

Be ready to take on a full-time developer role at ThoughtWorks.

Have clarity on our strengths, areas of improvement, and future path.

“STEP gave us the foundation—our next 7 months will prove that we’ve built on it.”

“STEP transformed us from learners into professionals. We’ve grown through workshops, errors, sprints, projects, and people. We’ve failed, supported each other, got inspired, and most importantly—kept going.
And as this journey nears its end, I can confidently say—we are not the same people who walked in 11 months ago.”
