## Curiosity & Excitement

- When we first joined STEP, we weren’t sure what to expect. But very quickly, our curiosity took over. From solving math problems to presenting in English sessions, we began stepping out of our comfort zones. Sprint introduced us to the world of low-level programming—it was intense, but fascinating. Everyone took the challenge of writing sprint in sprint. Bootcamp came in like a storm, but we learned how to stay afloat by asking questions, helping each other, and learning fast.

- Outside the classroom, our excitement only grew—whether it was cracking Advent of Code problems, exploring SVGs in our game projects, or getting our first MacBooks. One of us even triggered a fire alarm once out of curiosity!

- Every workshop, museum visit, or cricket game with mentors added to the thrill of learning. What started as nervous energy became genuine excitement. We were discovering not just tech—but ourselves.

## Challenge & Frustration

- Not everything came easy. There were moments when we felt stuck, confused, or just plain exhausted. Some of us struggled through math exams or English presentations. The spider-web activity during outbound took forever. Sprint nights were long, and coding tests with time limits pushed us to the edge.

- There were mistakes too—using ChatGPT the wrong way, naming variables poorly, or just not understanding what the code was doing. Bootcamp felt like it was moving too fast. Sometimes we faced tough feedback, and yes, some of our peers didn’t make it through. That hit hard.

- Even small things—like missing a homework deadline or dealing with PG food—tested our patience. But these challenges taught us resilience. We learned that failure isn’t final—it’s just feedback. And through frustration, we found a deeper kind of learning.

## Confidence & Growth

- With every challenge, we started growing—slowly but surely. Outbound activities helped us speak up, trust our teammates, and push our limits. We began to read code better, write cleaner assignments, and even started finding creative solutions. That built confidence.

- As someone once said, ‘Confidence comes from discipline and practice.’ This phase taught me that even the smallest steps are important — it’s about building the courage to speak up and the foundation for everything that followed.

- Mentors played a huge role. Their feedback wasn’t just technical—it helped us grow personally and professionally. Ganesh sir’s reflection sessions and CliftonStrengths workshop showed us who we are beyond code.

- We learned how to give and receive feedback, how to work as a team, and how to bounce back after a tough week. We supported each other—through illness, stress, and late-night debugging. Slowly, confidence replaced confusion.

- We weren’t just learning how to be developers—we were learning how to be thoughtful, responsible teammates.

## Joy & Celebration

- Now let’s talk about something that truly made this journey unforgettable — the joy, the laughter, and the moments we’ll always cherish.

- Whether it was playing carrom with Amreen Ma’am, cricket with mentors, or intense Mafia evenings — these games weren’t just fun, they brought us closer.

- And we had farewell parties that were emotional but full of love — like for Shyam Sir and Amreen Ma’am — moments where we celebrated people who helped shape us.

- Coming to the weekends, they weren’t just about rest and washing clothes — we had movie nights, documentary viewings, outing with friends, and sometimes… just long conversations that meant a lot.

- We’ll never forget the snacks mentors brought during Saturday work sessions, or the pure joy of Diwali gifts and New Year games.

- One special highlight was Jayanth sharing his love for music—playing the keyboard, ukulele, and showing us his creative works.

- And through it all — friendly competition, supportive teammates, and shared laughter turned even the hardest days into something special.

- These moments may not be written in our resumes, but they’ll always live in our hearts.

## Sadness & Resilience

- Our journey hasn’t been without its difficult moments. We experienced sadness when peers were terminated and when Dheeraj Bhaiya left us—those losses were hard to accept.

- Receiving tough feedback and termination letters tested our spirits, but the motivational sessions helped us find the strength to stand back up and keep going.

- We also supported each other through illness and personal struggles, reminding us that STEP is more than just a program—it’s a community that cares deeply.

- These challenges taught us resilience—the ability to face setbacks, learn from them, and move forward stronger together.

- It’s this resilience that will carry us through the rest of our STEP journey and beyond.

## From Practice to Purpose

- After 11 months of learning, reflecting, and growing — we’ve reached an important milestone.

- Starting next month, we’ll be part of ThoughtWorks project teams, working alongside experienced developers, contributing to live projects, and interacting with real clients.

- Everything we’ve learned — from debugging memory issues to navigating team conflicts — now becomes part of how we show up, how we take ownership, and how we deliver.

- We’ll enter a 7-month probation where it’s not only about coding but also about how we work together, communicate, and take responsibility.

- And as we take this next step, we also carry a responsibility: to give back. To mentor juniors, to share our learning, and to strengthen the very culture that shaped us.

- When we come back in December, it’s not just the end of STEP; it’s a return that marks a new beginning.

- This is our move — from practice to purpose.
